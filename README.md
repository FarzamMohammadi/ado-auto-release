## üé® Frontend

The frontend of ADO Express is a sleek and modern web application. Let's get it running:

1. Navigate into the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd ado_express_app
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   Voila! You should now have the ADO Express web application running locally.

## üîß Backend (API)

The backend (API) of ADO Express powers all of the magic behind the scenes. To get it running, follow these steps:

### Preparation

First, you need to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv ./venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows:
     ```sh
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Linux/macOS:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install Dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run the API

With the virtual environment set up, you can now run the API:

1. Navigate into the API directory:
   ```sh
   cd ado_express_api
   ```
2. Start the application:
   ```sh
   daphne asgi:application
   ```

That's it! You should now have the ADO Express API running locally.

## üí° Features

ADO Express boasts a range of features to simplify your Azure DevOps release management process. Here are some of the highlights:

- **Automated Release Management**: ADO Express automates your entire release management process, saving you time and ensuring uniformity in all your deployments. It prevents unwanted releases in deployments, and takes you from start to finish in your Continuous Deployment pipeline.

- **Search and Export**: With ADO Express, you can easily search through your releases and export your results to an Excel file. Whether you're using an ADO query or a deployment plan Excel file, ADO Express provides you with a detailed log of your release deployments.

- **Detailed Release Deployment**: ADO Express offers three types of detailed deployments: via query, via release number, and via environment. Each deployment type comes with its unique advantages, giving you the flexibility to choose the deployment method that best suits your needs.

- **Crucial Release Deployment Management**: ADO Express lets you mark certain releases as 'crucial.' These crucial deployments are run first, and in case of a deployment error, the application attempts to rollback and stop the processes.

- **Easy Run Options**: ADO Express provides you with a variety of ways to run the tool, from Docker to local execution, giving you the flexibility to choose the method that fits best in your workflow.
