Welcome to the ADO Express codebase, your new go-to tool for release management. This application is crafted to simplify and enhance the Azure DevOps release deployment process. It's intuitive, efficient, and powerful; ADO Express will revolutionize the way you handle releases.

## Quick Start

You have two options to get started:

1. **CLI Tools & Executables**: Get tasks done efficiently using either CLI tools or our plug-and-play executables. The CLI requires either Docker or Python, while executables are a hassle-free option requiring no preliminary installations‚Äîideal for getting started right away. For more on CLI, see [CLI Usage](#%EF%B8%8F-cli-usage), and for executables, check out [Executables](#executables).

2. **Web Application**: For those who prefer a more graphical approach with an intuitive user interface, you can opt for the full web application. For this option, proceed to [Web Application Usage](#%EF%B8%8F-web-application-usage).

---

# üñ•Ô∏è CLI Usage

Run various tasks through the CLI with minimal setup. You can either use Docker or have Python installed. Not only will your results be logged, but they will also be saved into an Excel file located in [deployment-plan](ado_express\files\search-results\deployment-plan.xlsx).

## Environment Variables & Command Line Arguments
### List of Variables/Arguments

> **Note**: The default values for these variables are either `null` or `false`.

- **EXPLICIT_RELEASE_VALUES**: A dictionary where the key specifies the type of explicit release values (`include` or `exclude`), and the value is an array of release definitions.
  ```sh
  {'include': ['releaseOne', 'releaseTwo', 'releaseThree']}  
                  (OR)
  {'exclude': ['releaseOne', 'releaseTwo', 'releaseThree']}
  ```

- **CRUCIAL_RELEASE_DEFINITIONS**: An array of critical release definitions, delineated by commas. These releases take precedence and will be deployed first. If any of these deployments fail, the entire process will be halted.
   ```sh
   releaseOne
         (OR)
   releaseOne,releaseTwo,releaseThree
   ```

- **ORGANIZATION_URL**: The root URL of your organization's Azure DevOps instance.
  ```sh
  https://dev.azure.com/{organization}
  ```

- **QUERIES**: A list of IDs or URL paths to ADO queries, separated by commas.
  ```sh
   queryId
         (OR)
   queryId,queryId,queryId
  ```

- **RELEASE_NAME_FORMAT**: The format for the release name.
   ```sh
   Release-$(rev:r)
   ```

- **RELEASE_TARGET_ENV**: The environment to which you want to deploy your releases.
   ```sh
   prod
   ```

- **SEARCH_ONLY**: A Boolean variable to specify whether or not to deploy the search results.
   ```sh
   True
   (OR)
   False
   ```

- **VIA_ENV**: A Boolean variable to specify whether the search should be based on the release environment. (Set to `True` unless searching for **NON**-deployable results.)
   ```sh
   True
   (OR)
   False
   ```

- **VIA_ENV_LATEST_RELEASE**: A Boolean variable to determine whether to retrieve the latest release from the environment. (Set to `True` only if searching via query OR for **NON**-deployable results; otherwise, set to False.)
    ```sh
   True
   (OR)
   False
   ```

- **VIA_ENV_SOURCE_NAME**: The name of the environment where you've previously deployed releases (the same environment from which you retrieve Rollback releases).
  ```sh
   qa
   ```

### Command-Line Argument Order
   ```sh
    <EXPLICIT_RELEASE_VALUES> <CRUCIAL_RELEASE_DEFINITIONS> <ORGANIZATION_URL> <PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> <QUERIES> <RELEASE_NAME_FORMAT> <RELEASE_TARGET_ENV> <SEARCH_ONLY> <VIA_ENV> <VIA_ENV_LATEST_RELEASE> <VIA_ENV_SOURCE_NAME>
   ```

## Docker Deployment

1. **Prerequisite**: Ensure Docker is running.
2. **Build Container**: Navigate to the repository directory and execute the following command:
    ```sh
    docker build -t <CONTAINER_NAME> .
    ```
3. **Environment Variables**: Configure the required environment variables in the [.env](/.env) file.
4. **Run Container**: Execute the following command from within the repository directory:
    ```sh
    docker run --env-file ./.env -it <CONTAINER_NAME>
    ```
> For more details on run configurations, refer to the [Environment Variables & Command Line Arguments](#environment-variables--command-line-arguments) section.

## Docker Development Container

1. **Prerequisite**: Ensure Docker is running.
2. **VS Code Setup**: Open the repository directory in Visual Studio Code.
3. **Environment Variables**: Update your [.env](/.env) file with necessary variables.
4. **Quick Start**: Press `F1`, then search for and select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.

> For more details on run configurations, refer to the [Environment Variables & Command Line Arguments](#environment-variables--command-line-arguments) section.

## Executables

Download the executables from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FarzamMohammadi/ado-express/releases) page. Opt for the [latest](https://github.com/FarzamMohammadi/ado-express/releases/tag/1.36.0) to stay up-to-date with the newest features.

To run the executable for your OS, execute the following command:

```sh
./ado-express-{OS}.exe <EXPLICIT_RELEASE_VALUES> <CRUCIAL_RELEASE_DEFINITIONS> <ORGANIZATION_URL> <PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> <QUERIES> <RELEASE_NAME_FORMAT> <RELEASE_TARGET_ENV> <SEARCH_ONLY> <VIA_ENV> <VIA_ENV_SOURCE_NAME> <VIA_ENV_LATEST_RELEASE>
```

**Note**: Executables will log output solely to the terminal and won't generate log or search result files. For such functionality, please refer to other [CLI execution methods](#%EF%B8%8F-cli-usage).

> For more details on run configurations, refer to the [Environment Variables & Command Line Arguments](#environment-variables--command-line-arguments) section.

# üñ•Ô∏è Web Application Usage

To operate the ADO Express Web Application, you must start both the [Frontend](#-frontend) and [Backend](#-backend-api) services of this project.

## üé® Frontend

The frontend of ADO Express is a sleek and modern web application. Let's get it running:

1. Navigate into the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd ado_express_app
   ```
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```
   Voila! You should now have the ADO Express web application running locally.

## üîß Backend (API)

The backend (API) of ADO Express powers all of the magic behind the scenes. To get it running, follow these steps:

### Preparation

First, you need to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv ./venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows:
     ```sh
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Linux/macOS:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install Dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run the API

With the virtual environment set up, you can now run the API:

1. Navigate into the API directory:
   ```sh
   cd ado_express_api
   ```
2. Start the application:
   ```sh
   daphne asgi:application
   ```

That's it! You should now have the ADO Express API running locally.
