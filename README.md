# üñ•Ô∏è Web Application Usage

To operate the ADO Express Web Application, you must start both the [Frontend](#-frontend) and [Backend](#-backend-api) services of this project.

## üé® Frontend

The frontend of ADO Express is a sleek and modern web application. Let's get it running:

1. Navigate into the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd ado_express_app
   ```
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```
   Voila! You should now have the ADO Express web application running locally.

## üîß Backend (API)

The backend (API) of ADO Express powers all of the magic behind the scenes. To get it running, follow these steps:

### Preparation

First, you need to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv ./venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows:
     ```sh
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Linux/macOS:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install Dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run the API

With the virtual environment set up, you can now run the API:

1. Navigate into the API directory:
   ```sh
   cd ado_express_api
   ```
2. Start the application:
   ```sh
   daphne asgi:application
   ```

That's it! You should now have the ADO Express API running locally.
